## Introduction to the Site
I have a deep love for hiking. It is one of my favorite pastimes and often a focus point of trips that I go on. I have found myself in a position at times though where I struggle to remember all of the hikes I've been on, as well as how I felt about them. I wanted to develop a website that not only lets you track your hikes , but also lets you see what other people have been getting up to.
